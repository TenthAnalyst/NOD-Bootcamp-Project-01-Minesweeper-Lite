# NOD Bootcamp Project 01:  Minesweeper Lite

- **Programmer:** James Harling
- **Date:** April 13th, 2023
- **Language:** Python 3.9.13

### Description
This is my first project for the *NOD Coding Data Analytics Bootcamp* in Stockholm Sweden. Only 9 days earlier I had learned *print("Hello world!")* and here I built a program that, without the use of object oriented programming, replicates the classic Minesweeper game using text-based graphics. It allows the player to uncover cells on a grid while avoiding hidden mines. The game provides feedback on nearby mines and tracks the player's progress.

### Initial Plan

### Presentation
After building the program I needed to present the challenges I encountered to the class, and the presentation board can be found here: https://excalidraw.com/#json=pNo1q9D_P6FKUR6OaqoJo,joO1rDXS2Lf-pSw2AfDHqw
